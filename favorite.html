    <h3>Interests:</h3>
    <ul id="interestsList"> 
        <li>Reading
        <p>I love reading.  I have read 48 books this year, and I love going to book sales 
            where you can pay for a bag and fill it with books.</p>
        <img id="books"src="images/books.jpg"></li>
        <li>Snowboarding/Skiing</li>
        <p>I started out skiing when I was younger and learned how to snowboard last year. 
             It was tough and I couldn't walk the next day cause I kept falling on my knees, 
             but I learned quickly and had fun.</p>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <p>Traveling is my favorite thing to do when we have weekends or vacations.  I love 
            exploring new places, or just relaxing by a fire in the woods or the beach.  So far, 
            my traveling experience abroad has been limited to Europe, but I hope to visit other 
            countries like Thailand, Japan, and Australia.</p>
