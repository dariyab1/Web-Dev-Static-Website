        <li><h3>Driving</h3></li>
        <div>I starting learning how to drive when I was 13 in the parking lot of Rockaway Beach, and then I got my permit when I turned 16. </div>
        <li><h3>Snowboarding</h3></li>
        <div>I learned how to ski when I was younger and then I learned how to snowboard last year.  My knees were busted the next day but it was fun.  I also learned how to waterski and wakeboard, which I think is cool because I can go on both snow and water in skiis and a board.<br>

        <li><h3>Crochet/Bracelets</h3></li>
        <p>Every couple of months I remember that I can make bracelets and crochet, though the latter not very well.  I made a strawberry cow bracelet before and I am most proud of that work.</p>
        <li><h3>Procrastination</h3></li>
        <p>This is one of my skills because I always push everything till the last minute, but always manage to get it done ~like this project~.  I guess this just means I know my limits.</p>
