        <p>I am a student at Brooklyn Tech and have been living in NYC my whole life. <br>
            I love to travel, and have been to many places this year.<br>
            I have a twin brother and a 14 year old shih tzu. This is a picture of him before I cut his hair.</p>
            <div><img id="rex" src="images/rex.jpg"></div>
            <p>My favorite food is pasta and I love sleeping, reading, and the rain, though not the kind that causes flash floods.<br>
